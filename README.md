# A RUBY 2-D Game for Beginners

This contribution is part of a bigger project focused on teaching easy Hi-level programming languages for highschool teens (or even kids).

It is a ruby language game project using GoSu-library (GEMS) embedded to be used as a sample tutorial for beginners who wants to learn coding. 

# Features 

There are some implementations of players, a basic scenario, and some movements using the keyboards inputs. Although, it is a template for any other game.
